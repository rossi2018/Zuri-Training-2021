#Variable 
#Variable is like a  container holder that can hold values 
#A variable allow you to put a single value in a container at a time 

cup= 'water' # Water is the content inside the container cup. Our container is a variable 
print(cup)

cup='sand'
print(cup)

#Limitation f a variable.You cant save operator in a variabl like this 
firstValue=50
secondValue=200
# operator= + .It will show error when running the code 

#Rules of variable
#you can't start a variable with number like this
#1stvalues=50
#2ndvalues=200

#You cant start a variable with symbols like $,%,&, etc

#A few things you can start variable with are
# 1. under score (_) .It's not advisable to do that 
_firstValue=50
# 2. You can use upper and lower case to name your variable
firstValue=100
# Writting variable using upper and lower case is called a camel casing which 
# basically means you start the first word with lower case and the subsequent 
# word with upper case 

# Another way to start a variable is called snake where you separate a variable 
# with under score.
first_value=300

#When naming a variable use a descriptive name but dont make it too long.
#Using a concise descriptive word make your code readable to people that 
# want to inherent your code
